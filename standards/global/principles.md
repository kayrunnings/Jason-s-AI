## Purpose

These principles guide all decisions across product, content, and design work. They represent our organization's core values and should inform every phase of the workflow.

## Musts (Non-Negotiable)

- [PRIN-1] **User-First**: All decisions MUST prioritize user value and experience over internal convenience.
- [PRIN-2] **Quality Over Speed**: Work MUST meet quality standards before shipping; do not sacrifice quality for arbitrary deadlines.
- [PRIN-3] **Transparency**: Limitations, risks, and trade-offs MUST be documented and communicated clearly.
- [PRIN-4] **Maintainability**: Solutions MUST be maintainable by the team; avoid clever solutions that only one person understands.
- [PRIN-5] **Incremental Delivery**: Large efforts MUST be broken into smaller, deliverable increments with measurable value.

## Shoulds (Strong Recommendations)

- [PRIN-10] **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones; complexity should be justified.
- [PRIN-11] **Collaboration**: Seek input from relevant stakeholders early; avoid working in isolation on impactful decisions.
- [PRIN-12] **Learn from Mistakes**: Document lessons learned from failures; treat them as opportunities, not blame.
- [PRIN-13] **Measure Impact**: Define success metrics upfront and measure outcomes after delivery.
- [PRIN-14] **Reuse Before Build**: Check for existing solutions (internal or external) before building from scratch.

## Examples

### Good: User-First Decision
> "We delayed the feature launch by one week to fix the confusing onboarding flow that user testing revealed."

### Bad: Internal Convenience Over Users
> "We shipped the feature with known UX issues because refactoring would require changes to our internal tooling."
