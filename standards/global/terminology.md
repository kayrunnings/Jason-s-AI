- [TERMS-2] **Avoid Banned Terms**: MUST NOT use banned or deprecated terms; use the approved alternatives instead.
- [TERMS-3] **Consistent Capitalization**: Product names and feature names MUST use consistent capitalization as defined.
- [TERMS-4] **Define Jargon**: Technical jargon MUST be defined on first use in user-facing content.

## Shoulds (Strong Recommendations)

- [TERMS-10] **Plain Language**: SHOULD use plain language over jargon when communicating with end users.
- [TERMS-11] **Acronym Expansion**: SHOULD expand acronyms on first use (e.g., "Application Programming Interface (API)").
