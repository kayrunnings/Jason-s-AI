## Purpose

These standards ensure Content Requirements Documents produce content that is on-brand, effective, and actionable for content creators.

## Musts (Non-Negotiable)

### Structure
- [CRD-1] **Standard Sections**: CRDs MUST include: Audience, Purpose, Channel/Format, Key Messages, Tone, Success Criteria.
- [CRD-2] **Audience Definition**: MUST clearly define the primary audience including their knowledge level and needs.
- [CRD-3] **Voice Alignment**: Tone and voice MUST align with VOICE-* rules in domains/content-voice.md.

### Clarity
- [CRD-4] **Clear CTA**: If the content has a call-to-action, it MUST be clearly specified.
- [CRD-5] **Key Messages**: MUST define the primary message (one takeaway) and supporting messages (2-3 secondary points).

### Compliance
- [CRD-6] **Terminology Compliance**: MUST use approved terminology per global/terminology.md.
- [CRD-7] **Legal/Compliance Review**: Content making claims (pricing, capabilities, comparisons) MUST note if legal/compliance review is needed.

## Shoulds (Strong Recommendations)

### Content Quality
- [CRD-10] **Approved Examples**: SHOULD include examples of approved vs. unapproved messaging or phrasing.
- [CRD-11] **Content Structure**: SHOULD provide a suggested outline or structure for the content piece.
- [CRD-12] **Word Count Guidance**: SHOULD specify expected length or word count range.

### SEO & Discovery
- [CRD-13] **Keywords**: For web content, SHOULD identify primary and secondary keywords.
- [CRD-14] **Meta Description**: SHOULD specify meta description requirements for web content.

### Handoff
- [CRD-15] **Deliverables Clear**: SHOULD specify exact deliverables (file format, number of variations, etc.).
- [CRD-16] **Review Process**: SHOULD note who needs to review/approve the final content.

## Examples

### Good: Clear Audience Definition
> "**Audience:** Mid-level engineering managers (3-7 years experience) evaluating developer tools. They understand technical concepts but need to justify ROI to leadership. Primary pain point: developer productivity metrics."

### Bad: Vague Audience
> "**Audience:** Developers and managers."

### Good: Specific Key Messages
> "**Primary Message:** Our tool reduces PR review time by 40%.
> **Supporting Messages:**
> 1. Automated code analysis catches issues before review
> 2. Integration with existing workflows requires no behavior change
> 3. Teams see ROI within 30 days"

### Bad: Vague Key Messages
> "**Key Messages:** Our tool is great and saves time."
