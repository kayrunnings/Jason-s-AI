## Purpose

These standards ensure all written content—product copy, documentation, marketing materials—speaks with a consistent voice that reflects our brand and serves our users.

## Brand Voice Attributes

Our voice is:
- **Clear**: Simple, direct language; no jargon without explanation
- **Helpful**: Focused on user success; anticipates questions
- **Confident**: Authoritative but not arrogant; knows the subject matter
- **Human**: Warm and approachable; not robotic or overly formal

*Customize these attributes to match your brand.*

## Musts (Non-Negotiable)

### Clarity
- [VOICE-1] **Plain Language**: Content MUST use plain language accessible to the target audience; avoid unnecessary jargon.
- [VOICE-2] **Active Voice**: MUST prefer active voice over passive voice for clarity and directness.
- [VOICE-3] **Scannable Structure**: Long content MUST use headings, bullets, and short paragraphs for scannability.

### Accuracy
- [VOICE-4] **Factual Accuracy**: All claims MUST be accurate and verifiable; do not overstate capabilities.
- [VOICE-5] **Current Information**: Content MUST reflect current product state; outdated content MUST be updated or removed.

### Consistency
- [VOICE-6] **Terminology Compliance**: MUST use approved terminology as defined in terminology.md.
- [VOICE-7] **Consistent Formatting**: MUST follow established formatting conventions (capitalization, punctuation, date formats).

## Shoulds (Strong Recommendations)

### Tone
- [VOICE-10] **Positive Framing**: SHOULD frame messages positively; focus on what users *can* do, not what they can't.
- [VOICE-11] **Empathetic Errors**: Error messages SHOULD be empathetic and actionable; avoid blaming the user.
- [VOICE-12] **Conversational**: SHOULD use contractions and conversational language where appropriate.

### Structure
- [VOICE-13] **Front-Load Value**: SHOULD lead with the most important information; don't bury the lede.
- [VOICE-14] **One Idea Per Paragraph**: Each paragraph SHOULD focus on one main idea.
- [VOICE-15] **Action-Oriented CTAs**: Calls to action SHOULD be specific and action-oriented ("Start your free trial" not "Click here").

### Inclusivity
- [VOICE-16] **Inclusive Language**: SHOULD use gender-neutral, inclusive language.
- [VOICE-17] **Global Audience**: SHOULD avoid idioms, slang, and cultural references that don't translate.

## Content Types

### UI Copy
- Be concise; every word earns its place
- Use sentence case for buttons and labels
- Keep error messages under 2 sentences

### Documentation
- Lead with the user's goal
- Include code examples where applicable
- Link to related topics

### Marketing Content
- Focus on benefits, not just features
- Include social proof where available
- Clear, single CTA per piece

## Examples

### Good: Clear, Active Voice
> "You can export your data anytime from Settings → Export."

### Bad: Passive, Unclear
> "Data export functionality can be accessed through the settings interface."

### Good: Empathetic Error Message
> "We couldn't save your changes. Check your internet connection and try again."

### Bad: Blaming Error Message
> "Error: Invalid request. You submitted incorrect data."

### Good: Positive Framing
> "Free accounts include up to 3 projects. Upgrade to create unlimited projects."

### Bad: Negative Framing
> "Free accounts are limited. You cannot create more than 3 projects."
